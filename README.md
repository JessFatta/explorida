### Overview

Explordia is the final solo project of Turing's Mod 3 inning. In this project, we were given full creative freedom to create a React app using any API we desire. Because I am a Florida local who loves the outdoors, I decided to use the National Parks Service API in order to create an application that revolves around Florida's beautiful National Parks, Preserves, Seashores, Monuments, Memorials, and Ecological & Historical Preserves.

This application allows the user to browse all that Florida's parks has to offer and gives insight on its designation, park info, weather info, and directions. The user is also able to see all parks or filter by designation.

This was a solo [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) and is built using React, React Router, JavaScript, CSS, PropTypes and utilizes Test Driven Developement and End-to-End testing with Cypress.

- The user can visit the home page to view all the parks at once 
- The user can also use the dropdown menu and select a specific designation which will display all parks of that designation
- The user can select a park which will take them to a new page that displays the parks's details
- At any time, the user can click the page title to return to the homepage
